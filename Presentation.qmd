# Facies

Sedimentary: a group of rocks and primary structures indicative of a given depositional environment (Marshak, 2018).

# Depositional environments 

Span scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers. 

When we study ancient depositional environments, we often have only a drill core, several rock samples of an outcrop: we see only a part of the original environment.

To extrapolate the rest we need a **facies model**.

# Tropical carbonate platforms

Carbonate platforms are marine structures built by in situ (allochthonous) organisms producing calcium carbonate.

## Identify depositional environments  {.smaller}

1.  Windward side -- a lot of wave energy
2.  Leeward side -- protected from wave energy
3.  Patch reefs
4.  Reef crest (long ridge formed by reefs)
5.  Lagoon
6.  Tidal flat
7.  Tidal channel
8.  Sandy beach
9.  Marsh
10. Shoals and underwater dunes - submerged ridges, banks, or bars that are shaped by waves and currents
11. Tidal ponds

|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| What type of rock is it?                                             |        |
| What is the texture?                                                 |        |
| What are the grains? Can you estimate what mineral they are made of? |        |
| How is the sorting?                                                  |        |
| What is the matrix?                                                  |        |
| What is it according to Dunham classification?                       |        |
| Have you recognized any organisms?                                   |        |
| In what environment would you expect to find it?                     |        |

## Create a facies model

Make a graphical sketch of an idealized carbonate platform.

Where is the sea level? 

What environments do you find above the sea level? 

...within the range of the tides? 

...just below the sea level? 

...in the photic zone?
